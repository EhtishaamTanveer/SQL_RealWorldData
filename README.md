# Working with a real world data-set using SQL and Python

### Description

This repository delves into the world of real-world data analysis using the powerful combination of SQL and Python. It provides a hands-on approach to working with public datasets available on the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork-20127838&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ)

I learned SQL and worked on this project while undertaking my [IBM Professional Data Science Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
The 3 datasets I used in this repo are:

1. Chicago Census Data
2. Chicago Public Schools
3. Chicago Crime Data

### Key Features

1. Real-World Dataset Integration: Utilizes 3 real-world Chicago datasets to illustrate practical data manipulation and analysis techniques.
2. SQL Exploration: Demonstrates writing effective SQL queries for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joining tables.
3. Python Integration: Showcases how to interact with the database using Python libraries (e.g., pandas) for further data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis.
4. Connection between SQL and Python: Potrays how a connection is developed between SQL and Python to write powerful queries in your jupyter notebooks.

### Benefits

1. Real-World Skills Acquisition: Enhances your ability to work with real-world datasets for various analysis tasks.
2. SQL and Python Synergy: Provides a foundation for combining the strengths of SQL and Python for comprehensive data manipulation.
3. Improved Efficiency: Demonstrates techniques for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data efficiently.
